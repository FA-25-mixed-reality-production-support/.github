### Ferienakademie 2025

# Context-based mixed reality support for production

In this course we will build two prototype for a failure management system. We plan to address two domains: dynamic parking and digital health.

The first project caused puzzle parking adresses the problem of bin packing - how can you arrange parking space in an optimal, similar to valet parking, but in 3D - the parking project consist of several use cases:

describe parking lot: each parking lot consists of moving platforms, which can be rearranged in 3D space to minimze the amount of space taken.

### Remote inspection

Drone creates digital map of the puzzle parking lot using SLAM technology. Due to failures the map needs to constantly updated and compared with a 3D model which then gets updated. Similarly, planned changes to the parking box should be visualized beforehand. For any unplanned changes notifications will be send to the specific users. The people affected by the changes are notified automatically. (for both planned and unplanned changes)

### Remote management and Maintenance planning

In this use case the actor is a manager for several puzzle-parking lots. The parking manager has a 3D digital twin of the real parking lot to get an overview on possible bottlenecks and necessary repairs. The manager needs to manage failures within the system

Visionary scenario: the manager receives a notice about a malfunction in a parking system. A remote Maintenance worker and manager can then inspect the failure of the system using argumented reality remotly to plan the repair. A repair plan is devised, consisting of navigation to the site, a material list and an estimated time to repair, all of which is optimized using previous failures.

(Translate use case to medical issues)

### 4 eyed repair inspection

### Tumor conference

We model the repair process similar to a tumor conference known from medicine. The purpose of the tumor conference is to plan a operation involving several stakeholders. Several specialists are required.

### Optimization of available space

### Rearangement of available space in real time

The goal of the Ferienakademie 2025 is to develop a flexible application which visualizes work instructions.  
_Input_: Textual instructions, 3D data, construction data, component plan  
_Output_: Video, cinematics model for AR & VR applications  
The goal is to flexibly generate a visualized output form based on the given inputs and an appropriate GenAI solution to enable industry 5.0 guidance in real world troubleshooting scenarios and manual work in production environments.

The solution can be applied in the following areas:

- Manual workplaces for complex tasks

- Maintenance actions during unplanned downtimes

- Work scheduling to enable flexible task switching

- Spontaneous handovers during shift changes

- Remote training
